# Create a Todo List rest api with Spring boot and Hexagonal Architecture!
Hi! This project was built as an example for a project that uses the Hexagonal Architecture. It helps us to figure out how to structure a project in this type of architecture. Hexagonal Architecture is also common named Domain Driven Development. As the name already tell it, Domain Driven Development is a process of development that make it domain oriented. That been said, it means that everything we are developing in those kind of projects are domain centered. Everything have to turn around the domain.

# What kind of application we are building
This application consists only of creating Todos.
